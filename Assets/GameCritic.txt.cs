// Is the game too easy or hard? It can go either way since a lot of the balls can either wind up bouncing themselves into their goal or it can wind up that they bounce at angles that make it very difficult to get them in. It is essentially luck based
// What would make it easier or harder? I think having a faster bumper would make it a lot easier since you would be more agile cover greater distances in order to hit balls into their goals. The game could be made more difficult by making the bumper a lot smaller.
// What would give it a "wow" factor? I think that some really cool scenery like maybe a space skybox and some mountainous terrain could really make the game pop.
// What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious? I think the chaos of having all of the random balls flying around makes it fun as you have to pay specific attention to the task at hand without getting distracted. I think what can make it tedious is that balls can get caught on certain trajectories that make it very difficult to hit them into their goal.
